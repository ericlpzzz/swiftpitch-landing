      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        SwiftPitch was created by freelancers — for freelancers. We’ve spent years on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr,
        frustrated by vague job posts, low-paying gigs, and the endless churn of proposal writing.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We built SwiftPitch to level the playing field. With AI, you can now scan a job post, generate a smart, personalized
        proposal, and focus on applying to the right work — not guessing what clients want.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        We believe freelancers deserve better tools, more transparency, and real support.
        SwiftPitch is our way of giving you an unfair advantage.
